Extracting mobile no.s from multiple CSVs with different / unknown column names
There are 50 odd CSVs coming in from the field sales which have the raw leads' information.
The information is very haph-hazard with missing column names, numeric inputs in string fields (and vice versa). 
The ides is to run a loop through these CSVs one by one and extract only the mobile no.s (and not landline no.s)
